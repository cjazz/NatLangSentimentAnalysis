**Mission Statement**

"Create a Chat interface that leveraged AI or ML
to produce suggested Emojiâ€™s based on what was being typed in the chat message, and allow that person to tap and insert the Emoji in the text message"

This sample app leverages one of Apple On-Device APIs Natural Language:   https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/api/#natural, https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage


A number of these API's enable iOS Developers to write less code
with more capabilities than before.  Vision is one very popular API for analyzing images, barcode reading, etc.  
CoreML is at the "Core" of the On-Device APIs.
